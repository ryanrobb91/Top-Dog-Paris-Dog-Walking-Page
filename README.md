I created an array to have a product list in my shopping cart but all the products aren't showing up like they should yet. I created a function that takes two or more values and gives you a total. My styling kept breaking my shopping cart so its definetely ROUGH righ now but that's going to be cleaned up soon. I created a form that on submit saves user information to an external file. I used json in that a little bit but I need to understand that a little better. I have a google maps on the bottom but I don't have it set up yet it just takes you to your location. I need to also add a calendar to accept a certain amount of bookings each day for different times.
